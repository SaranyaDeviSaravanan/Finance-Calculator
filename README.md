Investment Calculators

This is a React-based web application that offers two types of investment calculators:

Compound Interest Calculator - Calculates the returns on an investment based on compound interest.

This calculator computes the returns from compound interest based on the following formula:

Where:

A = Total amount (principal + interest)
P = Principal amount (the initial investment)
R = Rate of interest (annual rate as a percentage)
t = Time period (in years)
n = Number of times the interest is compounded per year

The Compound Interest (CI) can be calculated as:
ùê∂ùêº = ùê¥‚àíùëÉ

SIP Calculator - Calculates the returns on a monthly SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) investment.

The formula for SIP Investment is:

Where:

A = Total accumulated value of SIP
P = Monthly SIP amount (the amount invested each month)
r = Monthly interest rate 
n = Total number of periods (years * 12 for monthly compounding)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
